Hey, I'm Ken👋
Software QA Engineer / SDET focused mainly on Automation Testing. I build and maintain automated tests that ensure software is reliable, high quality and behaves as expected across web and mobile platforms.

When I'm not automating tests, you'll probably find me gaming or exploring something new in tech for fun.
