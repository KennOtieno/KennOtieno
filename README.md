Hey, I'm Ken👋
Software QA Engineer / SDET focused mainly on Automation Testing. I design and automate tests that ensure the reliability, performance, and quality of software across web and mobile platforms.

When I'm not automating tests, you'll probably find me gaming or checking out something new in tech for fun.
