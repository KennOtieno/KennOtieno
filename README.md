Hey, I'm Kennedy OtienoðŸ‘‹
Software Engineer focused on Backend, learning my way into DevOps. I build systems that aim to be reliable, scalable, and efficientâ€”balancing application logic with infrastructure know-how.

Most of my time goes into backend work, but Iâ€™m also diving into DevOps practicesâ€”thinking about deployment, automation, and how software runs in production. I value clarity, maintainability, and solving real-world problems over buzzwords.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring new stacks, tinkering with infra, or testing side projects for fun.
